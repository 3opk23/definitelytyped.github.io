                DefinitelyTyped is open source hearted and driven by a great GitHub community. GitHub is the
                home of all our definitions - just grab the definitions you need, download them to your
                TypeScript project and start coding. GitHub is also the place to work on definitions by
                submitting pull requests or reporting issues.

                The TypeScript Definition Manager or, in short, TSD is a powerful utility that allows you to
                query the repository and install definitions directly from your command line. TSD keeps track
                of all used definitions and can update them for you automatically.

                All DefinitelyTyped definitions are also available through the NuGet package manager right

                so you don't have to worry about outdated definitions.

            <h2>Why use DefinitelyTyped?</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                DefinitelyTyped is the repository for high quality TypeScript type definitions. It contains
                more than 500 definitions for the most important libraries out there.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-5 typography">
            <p>
                Code written in TypeScript includes additional typing information on properties, functions
                and classes that allow the compiler to perform advanced syntax checks. This ensures that the
                final application is running stable and smoothly and can be scaled easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other libraries like jQuery or Angular don't cary this meta data as they are written in plain
                JavaScript. A TypeScript definition file builds a bridge between those two worlds, it contains
                only the typing information the JavaScript library is missing. You may compare it to a header
                file in C/C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                As most of the available libraries don't provide their own definitions, DefinitelyTyped
                has been introduced to be a central place TypeScript developers use to create and share
                definition files.

                    <p>
                        With definition files for external libraries the TypeScript compiler is able to
                        check your code against otherwise unknown dependencies and provides useful
                        compile time errors.
